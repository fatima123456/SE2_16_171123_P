This sites gives information about the universities in Italy.
It gives the opportunity to the user to compare between different university, he just has to click on the button near the city of the University, and if he click it again the information about that uni will disappear.
The user can also filter the parameters in which he's not interested.
The ranking feature is not developed... it will appear a table with a ranking put by me, not computed on the information of the universities.



there is an unresolved bug, that if the user filters a parameter, and then "refilter" it the layout of the table is not as expected :)
